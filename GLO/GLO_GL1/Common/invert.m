% !!!!! Important comment !!!!!
%This function differs from the other versions of the invert function
%across the other SDRs. Old function was usin dec2bin matlab function to
%invert the data. Problem, in Glonass we need to invert data string of
%length 85, which is too much for dec2bin (max : 55). The use of sscanf
%takes care of the problem. If any question, please have a look at :
%https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/bin2dec.html

dataArray = sscanf(data,'%1x')';
result = sprintf('%d',1-dataArray);
