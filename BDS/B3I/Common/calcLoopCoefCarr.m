function [pf3,pf2,pf1] = calcLoopCoefCarr(settings)
%Function finds loop coefficients for 3-order loop. The coefficients are 
% used then in PLL-s to improve the dynamic performance of carrier tracking.
%
%[pf3,pf2,pf1] = calcLoopCoefCarr(settings)
%
%   Inputs:
%       settings      - receiver settings.
%
%   Outputs:
%       pf3,pf2,pf1   - Three Loop filter coefficients
